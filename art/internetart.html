            <p>
              Fio [name is progress still] is my Vtuber character who is an
              extension of myself. You can see her animated
              <a class="hyperlink" href="../theory/blog_4.html">here</a>. I drew
              her in photoshop and every feature you see is on a separate layer
              in order for her features and parts to be animated. I am animating
              her in Live2D, below is a video of the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason why I chose to do a Vtuber rig as my internet art
              project is because Fio exists only through my livestreams. And in
              my streams, my community can engage with her. I will have channel
              point redemptions that allow viewers to change her appearance or
              interact with her like patting her head [a popular Vtuber
              interaction].

            Bredikhana - Designing identity in VTuber Era
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Bredikhina (2020) begins to argue that VTubers are not avatars and
            that different cultures (like English, French and Japanese) inform
            different kinds of self-expression and community interactions.
            Taylor (in Bredikhina) highlights that avatars are an access point
            in which identity and social communities can develop. Bredikhina
            posits that VTubers identity is unique because the avatar itself can
            exist in different virtual and non-virtual worlds, as opposed to
            avatars that exists only in the context of a game or program. They
            state that VTubers “are only bound to the production of creative
            content and entertainment for viewers” which begins to lean into
            some form of surveillance. I would like to argue it as social
            surveillance, where content creators cater or mould their identity
            and self-brand to that of their viewers expectations through
            surveying what content gets best engaged with. This includes their
            own original content as well as following trends that may be outside
            of their usual content.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Bredikhina argues that VTubers existence is determined by their
            creative endeavours and that they cannot be analysed without their
            creative practices, thus a new type of research should exist to
            understand their identities. They then go on to state that there are
            two underlying choices that determine a VTuber's identity: the
            choice to construct their identity individually or communally.
            Individual creation implies an extension of the creator's self -
            this could be analysed through the 'suspended self' lens. Communally
            implies that the identity draws from the community in which the
            VTuber engages with.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The VTuber analysed via survey in the paper show that the
            construction of their identity as a VTuber came from the appeal of
            having their privacy intact (not subjecting their real bodies and
            selves to stalking or harassment) and the ability to being anyone or
            anything they choose. They also felt more likeable and beautiful as
            their avatars. Bredikhina mentions how VTubers 'perform' their
            identity which may be a segway into identity performance.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The VTubers described their goals as community driven, being more
            sociable in a personal capacity, creating positive and safe spaces,
            the transmission of knowledge, business intentions, and cyberspace
            awareness (as a living environment). The last three goals were
            posited by Japanese VTubers and the first three were posited by the
            English and French. VTubers link their identity to their
            entertainment abilities - they may be gamers or singers, crafters or
            storytellers Majority of English VTuber streamers prefer using their
            own voice (no modifications), gender and psychological identity.
            Some VTuber's exaggerate parts of their identity as part of their
            online persona. Other do prefer to create fictional personas. Those
            who also prefer to be the same gender say that the reason is because
            they are more comfortable that way, portraying themselves as a
            different gender would “demand great effort”. Bredikhina does not
            offer and argument on the orientation of these streamers - whether
            they are cis, heterosexual, or part of the LGBTQ+ community. These
            observations and results may have been different if Bredikhina
            included various orientations. Although, males in the study chose
            'babiniku' (virtual, incarnation), which is the act of using
            'bishôjo' (a beautiful girl), because they wanted to “feel desired
            and to be released from their physical gender and social norms”.
            Some felt female models are more appealing than male models.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Bredikhina concludes that VTubers create these identities to express
            themselves, as a communication tool and as a way of living. The
            J-VTubers who become bishôjo do so by “playing with visual and
            social [bishôjo] codes”, it is an act of gender performance.
            Bredikhina argues that these men are reconstructing issues of life
            such as social interactions, gender codes and bodies as babiniku “is
            an agency and a form of play to express oneself differently from
            social norms”. The statement 'a form of play' makes me think of the
            possible ludic systems that take place during the construction of
            identity.

            Yeo - VTUBERS: THE APPEAL OF CREATING A PUBLIC VIRTUAL IDENTITY
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Yeo's focus is on identity construction and performance. They argue
            that identity is constantly being “reinvented and reconstituted” by
            individuals who are navigating their public and private lives. The
            latest approach on the concept of identity is one of postmodernism
            “which separates identity from the essence of the soul” (Schier in
            Yeo). Yeo relates this to the freedom individual's have in
            presenting themselves in the digital world - individuals are not
            bound by physical location or context in on online spaces. They can
            be anywhere at anytime as anyone. However, as Yeo states, “identity
            and physical appearance still play a part in how others perceive
            them”. But for the individual, avatars allow a manipulation of
            identity.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Yeo, like Bredikhina, also defines VTubers in their relation to the
            activities they participate in - creators of content, singers,
            gamers, etc. Taylor (in Yeo) highlights that viewers watch streamers
            for their “personality, life, quirks and style” which is where I
            would like to connect surveillance again with the formation of the
            self-brand. A streamer (IRL or VTuber) is aware of the viewers
            reasons and intentions for watching them, so they may alter or cater
            their “personality, life, quirks and style” to the wants of their
            viewers to gain a bigger following and garner more engagement with
            their community. These motives are based on the neoliberal ideal of
            seeing oneself as a constant 'work in progress' or entrepreneurial
            endeavour. So, could we call this social capitalist surveillance?
            VTubers are “real people who are performing a public virtual
            identity separate from their real identity” that is informed,
            influenced, and possibly manipulated by their community and
            viewership engagement.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The separation of identity leads into some interesting arguments.
            One that Yeo presents is based on the event where Nora Cat, a female
            avatar, turned out to be performed by a middle-aged man. The face
            reveal did not receive as much backlash as most viewers were able to
            separate the two identities. Using an avatar as a stand in for their
            real identity, VTuber's are given the opportunity to create and
            perform as different genders and sexualities. Yeo also presents the
            idea that “homonormativity is a commodity” as VTuber's offer online
            spaces for the LGBTQ+ to participate in.
