        <p class="sub-heading">Bredikhana - Designing identity in VTuber Era</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Bredikhina (2020) begins to argue that VTubers are not avatars and that different cultures (like English, French and Japanese) 
            inform different kinds of self-expression and community interactions. Taylor (in Bredikhina) highlights that avatars are an access point 
            in which identity and social communities can develop. Bredikhina posits that VTubers identity is unique because the avatar itself can 
            exist in different virtual and non-virtual worlds, as opposed to avatars that exists only in the context of a game or program. They 
            state that VTubers “are only bound to the production of creative content and entertainment for viewers” which begins to lean into some 
            form of surveillance. I would like to argue it as social surveillance, where content creators cater or mould their identity and self-brand 
            to that of their viewers expectations through surveying what content gets best engaged with. This includes their own original content as 
            well as following trends that may be outside of their usual content.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Bredikhina argues that VTubers existence is determined by their creative endeavours and that they cannot be analysed 
            without their creative practices, thus a new type of research should exist to understand their identities. They then go on to state that 
            there are two underlying choices that determine a VTuber's identity: the choice to construct their identity individually or communally. 
            Individual creation implies an extension of the creator's self - this could be analysed through the 'suspended self' lens. 
            Communally implies that the identity draws from the community in which the VTuber engages with.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The VTuber analysed via survey in the paper show that the construction of their identity as a VTuber came from the 
            appeal of having their privacy intact (not subjecting their real bodies and selves to stalking or harassment) and the ability to being 
            anyone or anything they choose. They also felt more likeable and beautiful as their avatars. Bredikhina mentions how VTubers 'perform'
            their identity which may be a segway into identity performance.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The VTubers described their goals as community driven, being more sociable in a personal capacity, creating positive and 
            safe spaces, the transmission of knowledge, business intentions, and cyberspace awareness (as a living environment). The last three goals 
            were posited by Japanese VTubers and the first three were posited by the English and French. VTubers link their identity to their 
            entertainment abilities - they may be gamers or singers, crafters or storytellers Majority of English VTuber streamers prefer using 
            their own voice (no modifications), gender and psychological identity. Some VTuber's exaggerate parts of their identity as part of their 
            online persona. Other do prefer to create fictional personas. Those who also prefer to be the same gender say that the reason is because 
            they are more comfortable that way, portraying themselves as a different gender would “demand great effort”. Bredikhina does not offer 
            and argument on the orientation of these streamers - whether they are cis, heterosexual, or part of the LGBTQ+ community. These observations 
            and results may have been different if Bredikhina included various orientations. Although, males in the study chose 'babiniku' (virtual, 
            incarnation), which is the act of using 'bishôjo' (a beautiful girl), because they wanted to “feel desired and to be released from their 
            physical gender and social norms”. Some felt female models are more appealing than male models.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Bredikhina concludes that VTubers create these identities to express themselves, as a communication tool and as a way 
            of living. The J-VTubers who become bishôjo do so by “playing with visual and social [bishôjo] codes”, it is an act of gender performance. 
            Bredikhina argues that these men are reconstructing issues of life such as social interactions, gender codes and bodies as babiniku “is 
            an agency and a form of play to express oneself differently from social norms”. The statement 'a form of play' makes me think of the 
            possible ludic systems that take place during the construction of identity. 
        </p>

        <p class="sub-heading">Yeo - VTUBERS: THE APPEAL OF CREATING A PUBLIC VIRTUAL IDENTITY</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Yeo's focus is on identity construction and performance. They argue that identity is constantly being “reinvented and 
            reconstituted” by individuals who are navigating their public and private lives. The latest approach on the concept of identity is one 
            of postmodernism “which separates identity from the essence of the soul” (Schier in Yeo). Yeo relates this to the freedom individual's 
            have in presenting themselves in the digital world - individuals are not bound by physical location or context in on online spaces. 
            They can be anywhere at anytime as anyone. However, as Yeo states, “identity and physical appearance still play a part in how others 
            perceive them”. But for the individual, avatars allow a manipulation of identity.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Yeo, like Bredikhina, also defines VTubers in their relation to the activities they participate in - creators of 
            content, singers, gamers, etc. Taylor (in Yeo) highlights that viewers watch streamers for their “personality, life, quirks and style” 
            which is where I would like to connect surveillance again with the formation of the self-brand. A streamer (IRL or VTuber) is aware of 
            the viewers reasons and intentions for watching them, so they may alter or cater their “personality, life, quirks and style” to the 
            wants of their viewers to gain a bigger following and garner more engagement with their community. These motives are based on the 
            neoliberal ideal of seeing oneself as a constant 'work in progress' or entrepreneurial endeavour. So, could we call this social capitalist 
            surveillance? VTubers are “real people who are performing a public virtual identity separate from their real identity” that is informed, 
            influenced, and possibly manipulated by their community and viewership engagement. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The separation of identity leads into some interesting arguments. One that Yeo presents is based on the event where 
            Nora Cat, a female avatar, turned out to be performed by a middle-aged man. The face reveal did not receive as much backlash as most 
            viewers were able to separate the two identities. Using an avatar as a stand in for their real identity, VTuber's are given the 
            opportunity to create and perform as different genders and sexualities. Yeo also presents the idea that “homonormativity is a commodity” 
            as VTuber's offer online spaces for the LGBTQ+ to participate in.
