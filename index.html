            <p>
              Welcome to Keightyrose's site, one that shows my development over
              the semester and the passion project I am currently working on.
              Here I've covered my progress throughout making this website as
              well as the Vtuber journey I'm embarking on. You will find
              developer blogs, my internet art progress and my design process
              for my site.

            <p>
              I am a fourth year game design student majoring in Game Design and
              Interactive Media. A year ago I started streaming and now I find
              myself drawn to learning more about Vtubers. I have been learning
              how to draw and rig my own models as I want to start using a
              character as an extension of myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than that I am currently developing a productivity game-app
              hybrid where players study along with a character whose needs
              change throughout the study session. It is framed by the Pomodoro
              technique and will hopefully aid players in their own study
              methods.
