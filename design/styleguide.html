            <p>
              This stylesheet represents the theme that I've taken on for this
              site. It is inspired by the character I am drawing and animating
              for my internet art project. It's particularly inspired by her
              eyes. I wanted the site to complement the internet art, creating a
              contextual house that brings out the qualities of the artwork.

              This will be the eventual plan for the style section in terms of
              it's functionality. I was under the impression that along with the
              prototype for the internet art, this site is a prototype for it
              too so that's why I haven't gotten to implementing this design
              yet. I will attempt this design in react. I am going to introduce
              a side bar so that the wireframes for each page are separate from
              one another. I feel this will reduce the amount of scrolling users
              have previously been subjected to in my older sites' style pages.
              It will also help to organise information better.

              I want the index page to be explicit so I have included precise
              information about the site and myself. The imagery I've used sets
              the context for the site as hopefully many viewers will know the
              connotations of an emote looking image. Emotes usually link
              themselves to streamers and art that surrounds streamers and
              online content creators.
            </p>
            <p>
              The grid set up sets the premise for the website. I have chosen
              this layout as it organises information for viewers to read
              easily. I have matched the borders of the grid to the background
              so that the information looks more free flowing. This is to aid
              the viewers in synthesis the content they see and read.

                src="../src/images/Wireframe_Theory.png"

              I have made a main theory page that links to the developer blogs
              and the internet art page as both contain my theory progress
              throughout this semester. Again, this information is organised
              into a grid for better visability. When the user hovers over a
              block, it animates but slighty swelling. This is to help indicate
              that the block is clickable and interactive [by giving it some
              movement].

              I wanted users to see the visual of my internet art first as it
              contextualises the research that follows it better - as opposed to
              it being the other way round. The user will see my internet art
              first and then can see the way in which I researched and created
              the piece.
