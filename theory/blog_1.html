        <p class="paragraph">I have felt grateful that we have been given resources on the fundamentals of JavaScript,
          the videos we were given went over some key concepts that are important to our understanding of the language.
          It is a pity that we did not have these last year because I feel they would have made a huge difference to our
          progress. So watching them now also feels slightly redundant because the JS that was required of us last year
          surpasses basic fundamentals. It would be helpful to have more examples and code-alongs of JS in a website
          development environment.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I am really into VTubing right now - mainly the process of making models and rigs,
          animating them,
          and then making ways in which viewers can interact with them. So I would like to based my internet art on
          that. I
          just have to think of a creative way to display it on the website. I think the planning and process could be
          depicted
          really nicely, showing every step of the way. I am also keen to do this because I would like to learn a new
          skill, and
          learning to animate and use facial recognition technologies would be interesting for me to get in to. I
          stream, so this
          is leaning into a passion project for me.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I feel the readings so far have given us a lot of context of where internet art comes from.
          It is
          interesting that creatives have been finding ways in which to use technology and the web for art since its
          arrival to
          the average citizen. I feel that highlights artist's ability to connect the world through their creative
          visions, and
          it is inspiring. Knowing artists have worked hard to contribute to the development of technology makes me want
          to improve
          myself as an artist. I feel early digital artists have contributed to the development of programs like Krita,
          Illustrator,
          Photoshop, Procreate and other amazing art-focus technologies that are so pivotal to how art is made nowadays.
