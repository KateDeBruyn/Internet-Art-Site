            I've moved on to animating the rig in Live2D and it has made me
            think about the design process as an iterative one. As I animate, I
            learn how the rig could have been drawn better or drawn to allow for
            more functionality. For example, an artist I watched showed their
            PSD file and explained how they used clipping masks in the drawing
            process. One way to use them is for shadows around the body so that
            if the character turns its head, the shadow behaves in a more
            natural way by moving in and out of view. Another way clipping masks
            can be used are in the eyes, the pupils and irises can be masks of
            the white of the eye so that they only exist within the boundaries
            of the whites of the eyes.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Live2D does have a clipping function that you can use, so it wasn't
            an issue that I initially had not drawn my model with a bunch of
            clipping masks, but it is now something I will keep in mind when I'm
            redrawing the model in the future. I've also made the assumption
            that most vtuber rigs have fringes to enable more physics that frame
            the face - allowing for more movement and attention to detail. The
            side parting that I have initially drawn appears stiff in comparison
            to the bouncy fringe pieces in the tutorials I'm following. So, I'm
            going to give Fio a haircut. What I'm trying to describe is a method
            to the process - an iterative one where design continuously informs
            design. The design methods and tools used in Live2D depend on how
            the model has been drawn in Photoshop (in my case), and the
            redrawing of the model is informed by what Live2D has shown to be
            capable of and how it can be used. My model can look and operate
            better if redrawn with certain aspects in mind, like the
            aforementioned hair pieces and body shadows.
