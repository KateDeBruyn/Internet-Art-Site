            After reading Convention and Context by Mailloux (1983), I'm trying
            to think about the ways in which convention and context extend
            literary texts and form an observation of it in design. Mailloux
            shows that both convention and context are relevant to shared
            practices in interpretation. Interpretive conventions are part of
            context, but contextual features functioning as interpretive
            constraints transcend conventions. Interpretations of literary works
            are shaped by the context in which they are read and understood.
            With the readings that I've done so far that are about Vtubers, it
            makes sense that the literature and discourses surrounding them
            cover identity and gender expression. Because the very nature and
            context of a virtual avatar is to act as a stand in for a real body,
            so the nature and context of an avatar is to supplement an identity.
            An avatar also contextualises an identity through its features,
            mannerisms, and the environment it is found in. And convention comes
            into play when creating these avatars - like how most Vtuber avatars
            have an anime style to them, many take on wolf or cat ears or
            incorporate some kind of animal feature into their persona. There
            are many animal and non-human avatars too. But convention can
            already be found in the Vtuber sphere and the context of which can
            also be identified fairly quickly.

            In terms of the site, I've begun scaffolding the pages I need to
            include. I started wireframing and have begun to plan out my style
            guide. A small thing I have noticed so far is how I am organising my
            headings. Last year I was told that I was using my headings as
            stylistic choices (which Iman confirmed I wasn't but anyway) so this
            time round I'd like to try organise the CSS side better. Instead of
            making IDs unique to h1, h2, h3 and so forth, I'd like to make
            classes that cover big headings, main headings, and subheadings. And
            then use IDs for more niche ones that I'll need along the way. It's
            just something I've been thinking about through this design process
            as I'd like to have a design style that is organised and deliberate
            than my previous work.
